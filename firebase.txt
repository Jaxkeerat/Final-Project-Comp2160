Prerequisites
Install or update Android Studio to its latest version.

Make sure that your project meets these requirements:

Targets API level 16 (Jelly Bean) or later
Uses Gradle 4.1 or later
Uses Jetpack (AndroidX), which includes meeting these version requirements:
com.android.tools.build:gradle v3.2.1 or later
compileSdkVersion 28 or later
Set up a physical device or use an emulator to run your app.
Note that Firebase SDKs with a dependency on Google Play services require the device or emulator to have Google Play services installed.

Sign into Firebase using your Google account.

If you don't already have an Android project and just want to try out a Firebase product, you can download one of our quickstart samples.


You can connect your Android app to Firebase using one of the following options:

Option 1: (recommended) Use the Firebase console setup workflow.
Option 2: Use the Android Studio Firebase Assistant (may require additional configuration).
