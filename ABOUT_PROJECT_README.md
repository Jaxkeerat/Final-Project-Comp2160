# Final-Project-Comp2160
PROJECT GOAL 
-> An app to monitor the purchase of grocery and keep track of the “printed ”general expiration date of products.
-> Gives a prompt before the expiry date of products.
-> Provides general information to let the user know about how to check for a certain number of daily used grocery.
-> Stores all product data in real-time over Firebase and allows the user to click pictures and save on the online database.
-> This app does not promote wastage of food , in a way it will keep track of what stuff user has and what is needed so that nothing extra is purchased which will eventually save money.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
-> Our app allows user to add product data and save it over online database (Firebase).
-> Allows the user to click images and store them (locally).
-> Pulls the data from the database in real-time.
-> Has a general in-built database about commonly used food products for determining if the edibles are unfit to eat or not.
-> Has a separate activity for the products that have expired according to the printed expiration label.

SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT AND ASPIRATIONS
-> App can give a reminder before the expiry date of the food stuff well ahead of time, by giving a prompt of some sort.
-> Allowing the photographs of food products to be stored over the online real-time database, instead of saving them locally.
-> User can connect the app with their e-mail.
-> App could also calculate the expenses on food per month and notify the user at the end of each month.

CHALLENGES
-> The most important thing in the app was saving the data online over Firebase. And being new to using firebase, it was the most challenging to figure out how to implement it.
-> Hours of extensive research on firebase and after countless tutorials, firebase was implemented successfully.
-> Another, challenge was to set the image button for allowing the user to click images of products. Fortunately, after some Hit and Trials the code started working as camera is opened by our app, but it is still not completely functional as required.
-> The lack of proper communication because of being in different cities and availability was a minor challenge too.
